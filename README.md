## Abstract

Legged robots require numerous torque-dense actuators. This makes it especially valuable when the actuators are low-cost. The use of 3D-printed components makes this possible but comes at the expense of inferior tolerances and material properties. This can increase reducer play, which is resolvable using an anti-backlash mechanism.

In this work, two novel anti-backlash mechanisms for cycloidal reducers were designed and integrated into a compact actuator design. One uses a conically shaped cycloidal disk, the other uses a split non-pinwheel design. Several prototypes were manufactured and extensively tested in comparison to a baseline model. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms reduce play but at the cost of increased friction. Both function using an adjustable preload that can be configured for the intended application based on the trade-off between play and friction.

Furthermore, the designed actuator is of performance that is competitive with recent works. Using 3D-printed components proves to be a viable manufacturing method for cost-effective designs.
